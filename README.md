Project Name: Optimizing Cryptocurrency Trading 
Decisions Using Deep Reinforcement Learn-ing Techniques

Obejcetive:The objective of this project is to replicate the study titled "Recommending Cryptocurrency Trading Points with Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach," [1] which utilized Deep Re-inforcement Learning (DRL) to enhance cryptocurrency trading decisions. By adhering to the original methodology and employing historical data from Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum (ETH), this project aims to validate the accuracy of the study's results by comparing them with those derived from the replication effort.

Files:
simpleBTC.py
simpleETH.py
simpleLTC.py

The above are used to train the agent for 100 episodes  and the updated weights which yeild high profits are saved as best_model_number.keras.
Later final_test.py is used for testing.
